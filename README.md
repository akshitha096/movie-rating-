Movie Rating Prediction:
# Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts movie ratings using historical user ratings and movie features. The dataset includes user ratings, movie genres, release years, and other relevant features. The project applies various machine learning algorithms to predict ratings and evaluate model performance.
